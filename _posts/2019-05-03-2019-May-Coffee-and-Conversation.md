 - Friday, May 3rd is our next Coffee & Conversation, from 8:00 - 8:30 Am
 - Michael Baker will speak on Long Term Care…How’s Your Short Game? The LTC market is an evolving market and most advisors look to traditional LTC or life insurance or annuity based solutions. I today’s market advisors need to expand their thinking to provide optimal solutions for an unexpected health care event. Some people wait too long to purchase coverage, can’t afford “LTC” plans, or medically can’t qualify. We will discuss the Short Term Care market and the benefit these plans offer as a viable alternative to “LTC” when “LTC” is not an option.  
  - We hope you will stop by, grab a cup of coffee & join us.
